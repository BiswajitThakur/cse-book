# Elementary Data Organizations

## Data, Entity and Information
* Data represents a single value or a set of values assigned to entities. Data item refers a single or group of values with in the data
* An entity is a thing that has some properties which can take values.
* Processed or meaning full data is called information. This is used for taking some action.

## Primitive data types
* These are the data structures which are directly supported by the machine.i.e.Any operation can be performed in these data items.
* The different primitive data types are
    * Integer
    * Float
    * Double
    * Character
    * boolean

## Non Primitive data types
* These Datastructures do not allow any specific instructions to be performed on the Data items directly.
* The different non primitive data types are
    * Arrays
    * Structures
    * Unions
    * Class etc.

## Data structure
* A **data structure** is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory or even disk storage. An example of several common data structures are arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, binary trees, and hash tables.
* **Algorithms**, on the other hand, are used to manipulate the data contained in these data structures as in searching and sorting. Many algorithms apply directly to a specific data structures.
* When working with certain data structures you need to know how to insert new data, search for a specified item, and deleting a specific item.
* Commonly used algorithms include are useful for:
    * Searching for a particular data item (or record).
    * Sorting the data. There are many ways to sort data. Simple sorting, Advanced sorting
    * Iterating through all the items in a data structure. (Visiting each item in turn so as to display it or perform some other action on these items)

* Data Structures
    * Premitive Data Structures
    * Non-premitive Data Structures
        * Linear Data Structures
            * Arrays
            * Stacks
            * Queues
            * Linkedlist
        * Nonlinear Data Structures
            * Trees
            * Graphs

## Classification
* There are two types of data structure. They are
    * Linear Datastructures
    * Non-Linear Datastructures

## Linear Data structures
* This Data Structures involve arranging the elements in Linear fashion.
* Eg.
    * Stacks
    * Queue
    * Lists

## Non-Linear Data structures
* This Data structures involve representing the elements in Hierarchical order.
* Eg:
    * Trees
    * Graphs

## Data structure operations
* Operation means processing the data in the data structure. The following are some important operations.
    * Traversing
    * Searching
    * Inserting
    * Deleting
    * Sorting
    * Merging
