# Problem in Economic Decision Making
Economic decision making can be complex and faces several challenges, including:
1. **Uncertainty**: Dealing with uncertain future outcomes, market conditions, and project risks can make decision making challenging.
1. **Multiple Criteria**: Often, decisions need to consider multiple criteria, such as cost, time, quality, and environmental impact, which can be conflicting.
1. **Data Availability**: Insufficient or unreliable data can hinder accurate economic evaluations.
1. **Ethical Considerations**: Some decisions may involve ethical dilemmas, such as choosing between economic benefits and environmental responsibility.
1. **Human Bias**: Human cognitive biases can influence decision makers, potentially leading to suboptimal choices.
